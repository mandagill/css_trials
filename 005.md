Trial 5: Mixing and matching
=========================
We're going to mix and match both the horizontal and vertical stacking behavior in this exercise.

Using divs, create two vertically stacked divs. Inside each of these divs, place two horizontally adjacent divs.

As you do this, use the css margin to make sure things are evenly spaced.

Expected tags
-------------
* html
* head
* style
* body
* div (6)

Expected css styles
-------------------
* display: inline-block
* margin-top
* margin-left

Layout notes
-----------
* The top bar is red
* The bottom bar is blue
* The inner boxes are black

Layout notes
------------
* The two vertically stacked bars are 400x200 px
* The inner boxes are all 100x100 px
* The inner boxes are evenly spaced from the edges of the outer boxes
